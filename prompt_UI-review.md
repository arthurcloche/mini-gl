This is great, we are getting close to something greate ! 
I only have a couple more corrections : 

1. Texture nodes : when we render and redraw the texture, we need to ensure we are applying the Fit mode.
2. Settings panel : we will have a button to record from this panel too, it will do the same as the 'record' button in the top bar of the preview panel, and one should also trigger the other. Make it as large as the 'export as json' button. Also, when the recording is done, it should download. We also add button 'snapshot' in both the top bar of the preview panel and in the exports section of the settings, it will just take a snapshot of the canvas in png and download it.
